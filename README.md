- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ben
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning code, any and all variants. Currently going through Javascript as its a very popular language.
- I enjoy getting into a nice project, and learning about all the features.

Eventually looking into a new job role as a software developer, after honing my skills further and developing more complex techniques.

I have played around with React, and how react functions.
